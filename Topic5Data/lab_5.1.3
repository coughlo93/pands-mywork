# Create a program that puts 10 random numbers into a queue(list), the
# program should then output all the values in the queue, then take the
# numbers from the queue one at a time, print it and the current numbers still
# in the queue. (the command pop(0) takes the first element out of a list)
# Answer
# queue is [17, 73, 31, 89, 42, 19, 83, 86, 49, 62]
# current Number is 17 and the queue is [73, 31, 89, 42, 19, 83, 86, 49, 62]
# current Number is 73 and the queue is [31, 89, 42, 19, 83, 86, 49, 62]
# current Number is 31 and the queue is [89, 42, 19, 83, 86, 49, 62]
# current Number is 89 and the queue is [42, 19, 83, 86, 49, 62]
# current Number is 42 and the queue is [19, 83, 86, 49, 62]
# current Number is 19 and the queue is [83, 86, 49, 62]
# current Number is 83 and the queue is [86, 49, 62]
# current Number is 86 and the queue is [49, 62]
# current Number is 49 and the queue is [62]
# current Number is 62 and the queue is []
# the queue is now empty
