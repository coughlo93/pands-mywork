# Write a program that will read in the data for the data structure above, ie
# reads in a studentâ€™s name, then keeps reading in their modules and grades
# (until the user enters a blank module name),
# You can break this up into two parts:
# a. Just read in the module names until the user enters blank,
# b. Then read in the grade as well
# This program can just read in one student (and their module details)

# Part a: Read in the student's name
student_name = input("Enter student's name: ")

# Part b: Read in module names and grades until blank module name is entered
modules = []

while True:
    module_name = input("Enter module name (or blank to finish): ")
    if not module_name:
        break

    # Read in the grade for the module
    grade = int(input(f"Enter grade for {module_name}: "))

    # Append the module details to the list
    modules.append({"courseName": module_name, "grade": grade})

# Create the student dictionary
student_data = {"name": student_name, "modules": modules}

# Print out the student's data
print(f"\nStudent: {student_data['name']}")
for module in student_data["modules"]:
